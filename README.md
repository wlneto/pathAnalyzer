# Overview
This repository contains the source code for the paper "Read your Circuit: Leveraging Word Embedding to Guide Logic Optimization". It has the TCL and Python codes to generate and analyze the criticality of logic paths post-generic synthesis. The repo is organized as follows: 


- data: contains a shell script to clean-up the generated csv files that are used as input for training/inference. 
- src: contains the python code to generate the database with the extracted paths. 
- tcl: contains the tcl procedure used to extract the paths. This procedure might run for a long-time in complex designs. It also includes a simple Python script to parse the timing report and generate a csv file as the example files in the data folder. 
- work: contains all the python code to generate and save the database, analyze the database, generate the neural network, and generate the SDC file used in the flow. 

Some examples of database used in the paper are compressed in the work folder. Also, examples on how to create the databases are in the shell scripts also under the work directory. The examples contained in the folder with the comments in the code should be enough to get it running. More examples will be added when possible. If you have any questions, please contact walter.launeto@utah.edu. 

## Dependencies
- Cadence Genus for Logic Synthesis (the report timing script is implemented for Genus). 
- Python 2.7
